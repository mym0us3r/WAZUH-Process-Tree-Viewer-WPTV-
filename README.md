# WAZUH Process Tree Viewer (WPTV)
WAZUH Process Tree Viewer (WPTV) is a high-performance forensic visualization tool designed for the Wazuh ecosystem. It transforms raw Windows Security Logs (Event ID 4688) into interactive, draggable relationship graphs, enabling analysts to trace process lineages (Parent-Child) during Threat Hunting and Incident Response (IR) operations.

## Project Architecture & File Structure:
1. server.py: Entrypoint. The Flask server that handles web routing and serves the frontend.
2. process_tree_api.py: The Core API. Contains extensive logic for data handling and graph structure preparation.
3. logic.py: Backend Logic. Handles alerts.json parsing, UTC timezone normalization, and Hex-to-Dec conversion.
4. public/index.html: Frontend. Interactive UI powered by vis-network.js with Dark Mode support.
5. requirements.txt: Dependencies. Required Python libraries for the environment.
6. wazuh-process-tree.service: SystemD Configuration. Template for background service management.

🛠️ Installation & Setup
## 1. Directory Structure
We recommend deploying the plugin within the Wazuh dashboard directory:
* mkdir -p /usr/share/wazuh-dashboard/plugins/process_tree_api 
* cd /usr/share/wazuh-dashboard/plugins/process_tree_api
> Clone the repository files here < 

## 2. Virtual Environment
Isolate dependencies to prevent system conflicts:
* python3 -m venv venv
* source venv/bin/activate
* pip install -r requirements.txt

## 3. Critical Permissions
The service must be able to read Wazuh logs and be executed by the dashboard user:
* chown -R wazuh-dashboard:wazuh-dashboard /usr/share/wazuh-dashboard/plugins/process_tree_api
* chmod -R 755 /usr/share/wazuh-dashboard/plugins/process_tree_api

## Service Management (SystemD)
To ensure WPTV starts automatically and remains highly available, use the provided SystemD configuration.
> Create the service file:
* sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/wazuh-process-tree.service
